Automatically fetches Wheel links to display on your site, releasing you from the hassles of traditional link exchanges.

== Description ==

Forget about chasing down webmasters to get your link posted. Dump the multi-way link exchange programs that require you to spend hours of your time manually managing your link as well as the links posted on your site. Connect with our entire network quickly and easily! Our automated system publishes your link to other participating sites, just as it publishes their links to your site. 

Simple plugin---easy to install. No database tables are created; no complicated coding required. It just uses WordPress' native support for admin settings to store the two settings we require.  The plugin works by making a web request to an XLNKR server to get a set of one-way links to publish on your site. This is how your link will be published to other members' sites.

If you are not an XLNKR member yet, head over to <a href="https://xlnkr.com">xlnkr.com</a> and join the Wheel. All links are manually reviewed to ensure quality. We do not make false promises of thousands of links; our goal is to provide you with more quality one-way links to your site with very little effort on your part.
